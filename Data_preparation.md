# Time for the dataset!!

I download the Task01_BrainTumor dataset form (http://medicaldecathlon.com/) which conclude the dataset from BraTs. It is more stable and fast for installation. Firstly install the tar. to your remote disk, then unzip with the command in the terminal:
```
tar -xvf xxxx(path)/Task01_BrainTumour.tar -C /dxxxx/nnUNet/nnUNetFrame/DATASET/nnUNet_raw/nnUNet_raw_data
```
the data look like this(by keru_visualization.py):
